# 3D C++

This are the codes and project files from the book: C++ Game Development by example.

# About

This repo contains all the code from the book described above. The philosophy that i follow is to present the code every chapter as a separate unit of learning. Also i will try to update the C++ syntax to the lastest language standar (Currently C++20)

## Chapter One
This chapter presents the preliminary concepts about the language, from declaring variables to structs and pointers.


## Running needs

1. [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as a building tool
